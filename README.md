# Maris Game
*Note: This is still a work in progress, and subject to big changes.*

A game in the form of a webapplication, where players have to complete
assignments in real-world locations. The game shows a map to the player with
points assignments can be completed on.

Teachers manage players on their account and should be able to create
assignments, and approve returned answers.

This project is commissioned by Maris college.
